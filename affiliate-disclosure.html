                <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
                <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 5, 2025</p>

                <div class="disclosure-highlight">
                    <p><strong>As an Amazon Associate and participant in other affiliate programs, I earn from qualifying purchases.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h2>What This Means</h2>
                <p>DealHarvest participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may earn commissions on purchases made through our links. Here's what you need to know:</p>

                <h3>Amazon Associates Program</h3>
                <p>DealHarvest is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com and its international variants (Amazon.ca, Amazon.co.uk, etc.).</p>

                <h3>Other Affiliate Programs</h3>
                <p>In addition to Amazon, we participate in affiliate programs with various other retailers and merchants, including but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Major retail chains and online stores</li>
                    <li>Brand-specific affiliate programs</li>
                    <li>Commission-based partnership programs</li>
                    <li>Product comparison and deal aggregation services</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
                <p>When you click on certain links on our website and make a purchase:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are redirected to the retailer's official website</li>
                    <li>The retailer tracks that you came from our website</li>
                    <li>If you make a purchase, we may earn a small commission</li>
                    <li><strong>This does not increase the price you pay</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
                <p>Our affiliate relationships do not influence our content or recommendations. We are committed to:</p>

                    <li><strong>Transparent recommendations:</strong> We only recommend products we believe offer value</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear disclosure:</strong> We clearly identify when links are affiliate links</li>
                    <li><strong>No hidden costs:</strong> Affiliate commissions never increase your purchase price</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Independence and Editorial Integrity</h2>
                <p>While we do earn commissions from affiliate programs:</p>

                </ul>
