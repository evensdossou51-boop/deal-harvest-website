    "description": "This North Valley Spruce Full Pre-Lit Artificial Green Christmas Tree is 6 feet tall with a 29 inch base diameter. Featuring hundreds of individually crafted branch tips to create full bodied branches, this tree is designed to look and feel lifelike.\nFeatures 400 white lights that remain lit even when a bulb goes out. The lights are strung on the tree before packaging, offering an easier, more convenient set up.\nThis tree features pre-attached, hinged branches that drop down for a simple set-up and fold back in for quick and convenient storage. Set aside 45-60 minutes to properly shape the tree by peeling back the branches and pulling the tips apart.\nConstructed with sturdy, high quality materials, hypo-allergenic, fire-resistant needles, this tree is built to bring holiday cheer for years to come. Includes a durable metal base.\nAt National Tree Company, we believe that special holiday memories don’t have to be far and few between. This Christmas season, let our decorations transform your home while you focus on creating more of those magical moments.",
